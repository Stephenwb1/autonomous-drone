### Appendix 4 – Review

**One paragraph from each team member**

**Ethan Liu**

Our integration went well largely because we kept everything in a monorepo — mobile app, firmware, and documentation all in one place. That made it easier to coordinate changes, run tests across subsystems, and keep the design document aligned with the actual codebase. If I were to do it again, I would devote more time to the drone hardware side. Our effort was fairly evenly split between hardware and firmware, but in retrospect I would skew toward hardware earlier:soldering, mechanical assembly, and hands-on debugging of the physical drone to unblock firmware and flight testing sooner.

In this quarter we made a lot of good progress on our prototype and design. We went from nothing to having a working mobile app, working bluetooth connection to the drone, and all four motors spinning in response to the mobile app. One that that hindered my progress at least was my understanding of what was required of us in the class, I originally thought we were just building our design. It wasn't until like week 5 that I realized we're just building a prototype, and the main focus of the class is just the design. After we understood this, our work became more focused and we made more progress.

This quarter I shifted from the mobile app toward the drone's flight and sensing systems, which is the direction I said I wanted to take after last quarter. I brought up the flight control firmware on our board — IMU reading, the PID control loop, and motor mixing — and built a hardware-in-the-loop simulation so we could tune and test control logic without always needing a tethered airframe. On the app side I added the follow-to-phone navigation module and a follow-mock that translates navigation intent into the drone's command set, which gave us a working app-to-firmware path to demonstrate. I also integrated the barometer for altitude telemetry. The main thing still ahead is closing the loop so the flight controller fully executes those navigation commands in real flight rather than logging them, and if I were pacing myself again I would have started the firmware work earlier instead of carrying so much of the app focus into the start of the quarter.

I think one thing that went well during our project was the progress our team made on different parts of the drone. We were able to work on multiple components at the same time, such as the mobile app and the drone prototype, which helped us keep moving forward. Everyone in the group focused on different aspects of the project, and that division of work helped us make steady progress overall. If I were to do this again, I would try to better understand the main requirements earlier in the quarter, especially the design expectations and documentation that were required later on. Knowing that earlier would have helped me focus more on those parts of the project from the beginning and manage my time more effectively.

Looking back on what I worked on, which was the firmware and test development, one thing that went well was getting a reliable BLE link and Wi-Fi link. From there my teammate was able to take my code and their existing motor control code and combine them so the team could see and hear the prototype respond in real time. I also established a reliable Wi-Fi connection, and we used it for the communication between the drone and the user. I also worked on the GPS/compass bring-up, which was a core aspect of our autonomy. Where I would change my approach is in building an autonomy module that works on an existing functional drone. If I were to do this again, I would focus on creating a module that can be implemented onto a drone to make it autonomous, because then all of my work could go to the autonomy logic. Then we would not have to worry about the flight controller, PID loop, etc.

When I started working on this project, I had a lot of ideas on what could be integrated in this design. With a design such as a drone, there could be a lot of possibilities on how to add features. After figuring out what type of design we fixed on, then implementing some of the features will take more time than I realized. Before thinking more about that, I was assigned on making a drone shell that was necessary for the demo at the end of the quarter. So, coming with multiple ideas on what type of drone shell would work would constantly change. I made changes everytime there was a change in dimension as new parts kept getting added. In fact, we still don't have a finalized drone for next quarter yet because we have more features to implement. Maybe, I could have used some help on what features we would have finally implemented, but that's nearly impossible as features kept changing. My next attention is going to work on integrating more features such as a charger and camera into the drone shell and also make the drone fly.
