#### Division of Labor During Prototyping Phase

The table below summarizes each team member's primary areas of contribution from prototyping through the current quarter (Feb–Jun 2026). Work was tracked in Jira; deliverables are reflected in the GitHub monorepo.

| Team Member                | Primary Contributions                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ethan Liu**              | Continued mobile app development, including expo-router restructure, BLE fixes, manual controls, and WiFi/hybrid testing. Set up the Jira board, led weekly scrums, and contributed design-document appendix and evaluation updates. |
| **Cameron Dubois**         | Bootstrapped the mobile app (BLE, Connect UI) and hybrid comms layer. Contributed flight-control bench work, follow-to-phone navigation, and barometer integration across app and firmware.                                  |
| **Darin Rahm**             | Focused on drone firmware, including ESP32 BLE and WiFi connectivity, GATT command protocol, integrated GPS/compass bring-up and soft-AP/TLS integration. Authored the test plan and demonstration tests.                                                    |
| **Stephen Wend-Bell**      | Set up the GitHub repository and documentation pipeline; motor control functions and system diagrams. Integrated GPS/compass bring-up and authored technical design chapters on comms, telemetry, and mobile architecture.   |
| **Winnie Wong**            | Handled parts research and acquisition, PCB schematic, server integration, and campus drone flight guidelines. Authored camera-integration design content and component documentation.                                                          |
| **Abhiram Sai Yegalapati** | Designed and iterated the drone shell CAD model and wiring layout. Released new frame revisions as board and sensor layout changed.                                                                                          |

#### Collaboration

We used the following tools and processes to coordinate work:

- **Jira** – We used Jira with Kanban boards and Scrum to manage sprints, bugs, and tasks. Epics and stories were broken down into sprint-sized work, and we tracked progress through columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done). Sprint planning was held regularly at our first meeting of the week.
- **GitHub** – The repository was used for all code, documentation, and design files.
- **Discord** – Discord served as the main channel for day-to-day messaging, quick questions, meeting coordination, and sharing updates between synchronous meetings.
